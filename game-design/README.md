> I learned the mechanisms and math behind graphics engines and rendered 2D & 3D models with OpenGL, Blender, and Shadertoy.

These two models were built in Blender and rendered with OpenGL. For the donut, I followed the infamous [Blender tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z) by Blender Guru on YouTube. Then, for a "not donut model", I created a bee then created a scene because I was inspired by the bees in Adventure Time.

> As a Cognitive Cities Intern at the Qualcomm Institute, I found optimal places for solar paneling at UCSD's Warren College by utilizing Unreal Engine, Cesium, and Google Maps.

With this experience, I also provided testing feedback about how to make 3D modeling controls in Unreal more accessible. Some features I suggested to the Cognitive Cities team was to implement a snapping tool, scalar widget, and a right-click dropdown menu for colors and materials.

🐰🌿🐌
> The Mysterious Forest is the first game I created with a team at my first hack-a-thon ([ANova Hacks](https://www.berkeleyanova.org/)). It's a short 2D platformer with stylish pixel art inspired by open world JRPGs like Breath of the Wild.

> Fruit Slicer is an unfinished game for [GMTK 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024). The idea is to slice the food object and match the weight.  I hope to further develop this game!
